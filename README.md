commitlint configuration for system and apps with defined scopes, commit types and more.
By defining standard components of a system or app and using them as scopes, plus adding a few
related to commit types, we ensure consistency across our projects.

These are scopes that should be common in most systems, we call these components:

* **auth:** Authentication, login, OAuth, etc.
* **forms:** General user input, forms, etc.
* **navigation:** Navigation, history and routing.
* **networking":** Network-related code, connectivity checks, offline persistence, etc.
* **notifications:** Notification code, in-app notifications, push notifications, etc.
* **profile:** User profile, friends, followers, etc.
* **settings:** Settings and preferences.
* **system**: A general catch-all, for changes that impact many areas of the system.

We define 4 scopes you can use if you're interested in highlighted which platform
is affected by the changes:

* **core**: Shared code.
* **native**: Mobile platforms.
* **desktop**: Desktop platforms.
* **web**: Web platforms.

And finally, we define general scopes that refer to the nature of the change:

* build
* deps
* packaging
* release

But more importantly, we allow you to customize these.
`system` refers to the above. You can include your packages in the `packages`
section, and you can customize your `components`, along with descriptions.


## Installing / Getting Started

Create a `.commitlint-patterns.json` at the root of your respository.
See `examples/commitlint-pattern.json`.

Extend your config with this one. In `commitlint.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: ['config-conventional-system']
}
```

### Prerequisites

```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, 
local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

## Versioning
